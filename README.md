# Exchange-Simulator
'Finance &amp; Programming' Project for University

A crytpo simulator to buy and sell crypto-stocks for educational purposes, shows your portfolio and how you are currently doing, with some metrics such as balance and account statement to know how everything is going.7

Used Streamlit for an easy and basic interface. It runs only if *app.py* es executed.

*main.py* is the first document for running it on the python console/terminal without interface.
